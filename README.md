# Vrp-Problem 
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem in which a set of customers must be served by a fleet of vehicles based on certain constraints and objectives. The main objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by the vehicles, while also satisfying constraints such as the capacity of each vehicle and the time window in which each customer must be served.
solve vrp problem using genetic algorithm

# A genetic algorithm(GA) 
GA is a search-based optimization algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. The goal of a GA is to find the optimal solution to a problem by iteratively generating and improving a population of candidate solutions.

The GA starts by randomly generating an initial population of candidate solutions (chromosomes), which represent possible solutions to the problem. Each chromosome is then evaluated using a fitness function that quantifies how well it solves the problem. The chromosomes with the highest fitness are selected for reproduction, and their genes (parts of the solution) are combined to create new offspring chromosomes. The offspring chromosomes are then subject to genetic operators such as mutation and crossover, which introduce variation into the population.

The new population of chromosomes is evaluated using the fitness function, and the process of selection, reproduction, and genetic operators is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found or a stopping criterion is met. The algorithm often converges to a good solution quickly, but there is no guarantee that it will find the optimal solution.
